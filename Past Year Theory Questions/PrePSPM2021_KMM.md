# **Question 02**

The following procedure describe how a bookstore calculates the price of an order from the total book price and the number of book that were ordered. Draw the flowchart for the procedure.

<div style = "border: 1px solid white; padding: 10px; border-radius: 10px">
    First enter the total book price and the number of books. Then calculate the tax (7.5% of the total book price) and calculate the shipping charge (RM 2 per book). Next, the price of the order is the sum of the total book price, the tax and the shipping charge. Print the price of the order.
