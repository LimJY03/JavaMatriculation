# **Question 01**

DG Tech Sdn Bhd is a software development company in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. One of their customers, DIY Mart requests a solution to allow their shoppers to shop online using mobile applications. As a project manager of DG Tech, you set up a meeting with your team members to kick off the project.

As a project manager, suggest the appropriate steps in sequence in order to develop the solution.

> | Steps | Description |
> | :---: | --- |
> | Problem Analysis<br>&ensp; | We will identify the problem statement and break the problem down<br>into parts so that the problem can be understood and solved easily. |
> | Design a Solution<br>&ensp; | We will find a logical sequence of steps to solve the problem by using<br>algorithms such as pseudocode and flowchart. |
> | Implementation<br>&ensp; | We will implement the algorithm by writing computer program using<br>programming language such as `Java`. |
> | Testing | We will then test our program to identify and eliminate possible bugs. |
> | Documentation | We will also write and publish a detailed description about this mobile<br>application project . |
> | Review<br>&ensp; | We will then send the created application to DIY Mart for review and<br>approval before delivering to the customers. |

Justify one (1) importance of **problem analysis** in project development.

> To better understand and solve the problem by breaking it down into parts. The common problem analysis is by stating the input, process and output of the project.

Discuss two (2) benefits of **testing** step before delivering the system to the customer.

> * To eliminate any possible syntax error and runtime error due to careless in typing the code. This is to prevent customers from facing program failures when using the system.
> 
> * To ensure that there are no logic errors due to inappropriate coding sequence and operator usage. This is to prevent bug abusing by customers that can cause data mismatched between the system and the actual situation.

# **Question 02**

You are writing a program to display student's grade. The grade is based on mark as shown in the table below. Use the appropriate control structure to display the grade when the user enters the mark. If the user enters an invalid range of mark, the program should display message "Range of mark should between 0 to 100".

| Mark | Grade |
| :---: | :---: |
| 80 - 100 | A |
| 65 - 79 | B |
| 50 - 64 | C |
| 40 - 49 | D |
| 0 - 39 | E |

Based on the given scenario, design the algorithm using a flowchart.

>
> * Correction on flowchart: Selection for `grade = D` and `grade = E` should be `mark >= 40` instead of `mark >= 50`.

# **Question 03**

Write a `Java` statement to declare and create an object for a class named MyCampus.

> ```java
> MyCampus object = new MyCampus();
> ```

Give the output of the following `Java` statements.

```java
System.out.print("**** ");
System.out.println("###");
System.out.print("**");
System.out.println("*");
```

> ```markdown
> **** ###
> ***
> ```

Give the value of the following expressions

> | Expression | Value |
> | :--- | :---: |
> | `true \|\| false && 7 < 8 \|\| !(4 == 5)` | `true` |
> | `(6 % 4) % 5` | 2 |

Write `Java` statement to declare `x` and `y` as integer variables, then initialize `x` to 4 and `y` to 10.

> ```java
> int x = 4, y = 10;
> ```

Write `Java` statements to swap the values of `p` and `q`. Declare additional variables if necessary. Assume `p` and `q` are both integer variables.

> ```java
> int temp = p;
> p = q;
> q = temp;
> ```

Assume that all variables and `input` (a Scanner) has been properly declared. Give the output of the following program segment if the input is 30, 25, 11, 10 and -1.

```java
num = input.nextInt();
sum = num;

while(num != -1){

    num = input.nextInt();
    sum += num; // sum = sum + num
}

System.out.print(" Sum = " + sum);
```

> ```markdown
> 75
> ```

Write a program segment using `for` to sum all the multiples of 5 from 1 to 100.

> ```java
> int sum = 0;
> 
> for(int i = 1; i <= 100; i++){
> 
>     if(i % 5 == 0)(
>         sum += i;
>     )
> }
> ```

Give the output of the following program segment.

```java
double A = 0;

for(int x = 3; x < 8; x = x + 1){

    if(x < 4)
        A = (x * x) - 1;
    else if(x < 6)
        A = 5 + x;
    else
        A = 20 - (x * x);
    
    System.out.println("x = " + x + ", A(" + x + ") = " + A);
}
```

> ```markdown
> x = 3, A(3) = 8.0
> x = 4, A(4) = 9.0
> x = 5, A(5) = 10.0
> x = 6, A(6) = -16.0
> x = 7, A(7) = -29.0
> ```

# **Question 04**

Write a program that reads number of COVID-19 cases for each of the 14 states in Malaysia on 31st of August 2020 into an array. Based on the table below, the program must determine:

* The highest number of cases among the 14 states on the specified day.
* The number of cases for each zone (i.e. red zone, yellow zone and green zone).

| Number of Cases | Zone Classification |
| :---: | :---: |
| 0 | Green |
| 1 - 40 | Yellow |
| More than 40 | Red |
