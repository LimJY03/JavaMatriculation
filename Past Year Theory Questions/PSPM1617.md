# **Question 01**

Puan Rose is planning to prepare a healthy breakfast for her family. She needs to buy a few items and needs to calculate the **total price** based on the **price** and **quantity** of each item that she wants to buy. For items with the **item code** of 5000 and above, 6% of Good and Service Tax (GST) will be imposed. The calculation process is finished when she enters 0 for the value of the **item code**.

Identify the input, process and output.

> **INPUT**
> 
> * price, quantity, itemCode
> 
> **PROCESS**
> 
> * Calculate the totalPrice based on the price and quantity for every items.
> * Determine if GST is imposed based on the itemCode.
> * Repeat the process until itemCode = 0.
> 
> **OUTPUT**
>
> * totalPrice

Write a pesudocode to calculate and display the **total price** including GST, if any.

# **Question 02**

Indah Jaya Shopping Complex charges RM4.00 per hour to park for the first 3 hours. For the next 2 hours, the charge is RM3.00 per hour and RM2.50 per hour for the subsequent two hours. A flat rate of RM25.00 is charged if the car parks for more than 7 hours. Draw a flowchart to calculate the **total parking fees**.

# **Question 03**

Write java assignment statements for the following algebraic equations.

D = √((a-b)² + (c-d)²)

> ```java
> double D = Math.sqrt(Math.pow((a - b), 2) + Math.pow((c - d), 2));
> ```

Y = (a² + 4ab) / √(a³)

> ```java
> double Y = (Math.pow(a, 2) + (4 * a * b)) / Math.sqrt(Math.pow(a, 3));
> ```

Give the value of the following java expressions.

> | Java Expression | Answer |
> | :--- | :---: |
> | `49 % 5 / 2 + 1` | `3` |
> | `48 % 5 / (2 + 1)` | `1` |
> | `10 * (4 - 2 / 2) * 3` | `90` |
> | `5 + 6 / 3 * 2` | `9` |
> | `5 * 6 + 3 * 2` | `36` |

# **Question 04**

Study the program segment below and answer the questions that follow.

```java
double Temp = sc.nextDouble();

if(Temp > 37)
    System.out.print("You may have a fever ");
    
System.out.println("please seek help at the nearest clinic.");
```

Provide the output for the following inputs:

> | Input | Output |
> | :---: | :--- |
> | 40 | `You may have a fever please seek help at the nearest clinic.` |
> | 35 | `please seek help at the nearest clinic.` |
> | 37 | `please seek help at the nearest clinic.` |

Rewrite the following program segment using the `while` segment. (Assume that all `int` variables have already been declared.)

```java
z = 100;

for(x = 0, x <= 3; x = x + 1)
    z = z - x;

System.out.print(z);
```

> ```java
> x = 0;
> z = 100;
> 
> while(x <= 3){
>     z = z - x;
>     x++;
> }
> 
> System.out.print(z);
> ```

State the output of the program segment.

What is the output of the following program segment?

```java
int a = 1;
int b = 2;
int c = 3;
int d = 4;
int k = 5;

while(k > 0){
    a = b + c;
    d = c;
    c = a;

    System.out.print(c + " " + d + "\n ");

    k = k - 1;
}
```
