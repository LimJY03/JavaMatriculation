# **Question 01**

The following `Java` codes contain syntax errors. Rewrite the correct version of each code.

> | |  Codes | Correct Version |
> | :---: | :--- | :--- |
> | (i) | `x == x + y / c` | `x = x + y / c` |
> | (ii) | `int x = 100;`<br>`System.out.println(Value =, x);`<br>`//Required output: Value x = 100` | `int x = 100;`<br>`System.out.println("Value = " + x);` |
> | (iii) | `/* To output Hello String`<br>`System.out.print(Hello);` | `// To output Hello String`<br>`System.out.print("Hello String");` |

Based on the following statements, write the correct `Java` codes.

> | Statements | Correct Java Codes |
> | --- | --- |
> | Declare a constant `PI` and assign it with value 3.14 | `final double PI = 3.14;` |
> | Increment an integer variable `incr` by 3. | `incr += 3;` |
> | Declare a variable `pass` which will be assigned true<br>if `mark` is equal to or greater than 50 | `if(mark >= 50)`<br>&emsp;`boolean pass = true;` |

Based on the given `Java` expressions, determine the operator type.

> | Java Expressions | Operator Type |
> | :---: | :---: |
> | `(x < y)` | Relational Operator |
> | `(x && y)` | Logical Operator |
> | `x == y` | Relational Operator |

State the reason why the list of sequence characters given are invalid identifiers.

> | The Identifier | Reason |
> | --- | --- |
> | `double` | `double` is a `Java` reserved keyword. |
> | `s -name` | Spacing is not allowed in naming identifiers.<br>`-` is a `Java` operator and should not be used<br>in naming identifiers. |
> | `3num` | `Java` identifiers cannot start with a number. |

# **Question 02**

The following questions refer to `Java` array.

Describe the following declaration statement. Hence, state the highest index of `bookPrice`.

```java
double[] bookPrice = new double[20];
```

> The array `bookPrice` that holds `double` datatype that can store up to 20 elements is declared.
>\
> The highest index of `bookPrice` is 19.

Determine the number of input(s) that is read based on the following input statement.

```java
Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
int item[] = new int[20];
item[10] = in.nextInt();
```

> One input. It is loaded to the array at index 10.

Explain one (1) difference between standard library (package) and user-defined methods in `Java` Programming.

> | Standard Library Methods | User-Defined Methods |
> | --- | --- |
> | Standard Library Methods are built-in `Java` methods that<br>can be used readily. Examples of Standard Library Methods<br>are `print()` and `sqrt()`.| User-defined methods are methods created and written<br>by users based on the requirement in their program. |

Give an example for the given method structure or type based on the following code segment.

```java
int maximum(int p, int q){

    if(p > q)
        return p;
    else
        return q;
}

public static void main(String[] args){

    double x = Math.sqrt(100.0);
    int y = maximum(a, b)
}
```

> | Method Structure or Type | Example |
> | :---: | :---: |
> | User-Defined Method Name | `maximum` |
> | Standard Library | `sqrt` |
> | Parameter List for User-Defined Method | `int p, int q` |

# **Question 05**

Write `Java` assignment statements for the following algebraic equations.

*y* = *a*² + *b*² - 4*ac* 

> ```java
> double y = Math.pow(a, 2) + Math.pow(b, 2) - (4 * a * c);
> ```

*x* = (2(*a*² + *c*²) + *ab*) / √(*a* + *c*)

> ```java
> double x = (2 * (Math.pow(a, 2) + Math.pow(c, 2)) + (a * b)) / Math.sqrt(a + c);
> ```

Given the following `Java` codes, determine the value of `c` and `y`.

```java
int a = 10, b = 5;
double c = 2, x = 4.2, y = 33, z = 2.0;

c = a + b - x / c;
y = 56 % 5 / 2 + a;
```

> `c` = 12.9
> \
> `y` = 10.0

The women long jump competition has `n` athletes. Each athlete is given two jumps and the winner is determined based on the longest jump distance (in metre). The first line of input is `n`, representing the number of athletes. 

It is then followed by n lines, each line contains three inputs which are:

* The athlete's identification number
* The distance of the first jump
* The distance of the second jump

Write a complete `Java` program to find and print the winning athlete's identification number and her winning jump distance.
