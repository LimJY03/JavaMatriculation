# **Question 01**

With the escalating price of fuel, the need to understand the car fuel consumption has become increasingly important. In April 2017, you have made 10 journeys. You want to know the **average fuel consumptions** for month of April 2017. Assume that your car can read the mileage, in kilometer (km) and also the fuel tank level, in litre (L) at the beginning and at the end of each journey.

Identify the input, process and output.

> **INPUT**
> 
> * mileage, fuelInitial, fuelFinal
> 
> **PROCESS**
> 
> * Calculate fuelConsume for each journey.
> * Repeatedly sum fuelConsume until 10 journeys.
> * Determine fuelAverage.
> 
> **OUTPUT**
> 
> * fuelAverage

Draw a flowchart to solve the problem.

# **Question 02**
Rewrite the following Java program segment to convert Celcius to Fahrenheit using a `for` loop statement.

```java
double c = 0, f;

System.out.print("Celcius to Fahrenheit");

while(c <= 100){
    f = 23 + 9 * c / 5;
    c = c + 10;
}
```

> ```java
> double f = 0.0;
> 
> System.out.print("Celcius to Fahrenheit");
> 
> for(double c = 0; c <= 100; c += 10){
>     f = (23 + (9 * c) / 5);
> }
> ```

Write the output produced by the following Java program segment:

**SEGMENT 01**

```java
int A = 1;
int B = 2;

if(((A == 1) || (B == 2)) && (B == 0))
    System.out.print("This exam was difficult");
else
    System.out.print("This exam was easy");
```

> ```markdown
> This exam was easy
> ```

**SEGMENT 02**

```java
char A = 'S';
char B = 'Z';

if(A > B)
    System.out.print(A);
else
    System.out.print(B);
```

> ```markdown
> Z
> ```

**SEGMENT 03**

```java
int x = 17;

while(x > 3){
    x = x - 5;
    System.out.println(x);
}
```

> ```markdown
> 12
> 7
> 2
> ```

**SEGMENT 04**

```java
int x;
double y;

x = (11 % 3) * 2 - 3 / 2 + 1;
y = (5/2.0 + 1.5 + 3) * 2 / 4 + 1;

System.out.println(x + "\t" + y);
```

> ```markdown
> 4   4.5
> ```

Given that *x* is 5, *y* is 7 and *z* is 2. Determine the truth value of the following Java expressions. Assume all variables used are type `int`.

> | Expressions | Truth Value |
> | :--- | :---: |
> | `x + y >= y - z` | `true` |
> | `y / z < (y / x) * z` | `false` |

Trace the following Java program and write the output.

```java
/* This program calculates the sale price of an item that
is regularly price at RM70.00, with a 30% discount.*/

import java.util.Scanner;
class SALEprice{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        // Variables to hold the regular price, amount of discount and sale price
        double regularPrice = 70.00, discount, salePrice;

        // Calculate the amount of a 30% discount
        discount = regularPrice * 0.3;

        // Calculate the sale price by subtracting the discount from regular price
        salePrice = regularPrice - discount;

        // Display the results
        System.out.println("Regular price: RM" + regularPrice);
        System.out.println("Discount amount : RM" + discount);
        System.out.println("Sale price: RM" + salePrice);
    }
}
```

> | `discount` | `salePrice` |
> | :---: | :---: |
> | `21.0` | `49.0` |

> ```markdown
> Regular price: RM70.0
> Discount amount: RM21.0

# **Question 03**

Given a mathematics equation below:

*C* = 3*t*² + 5 

Rewrite the equation in Java statement:

> ```java
> C = 3 * Math.pow(t, 2) + 5;
> ```

Write a Java program segment to display all the values of *C* where the values of *t* are ranging from -10 to 10.

> ```java
> for(int t = -10; t <= 10; t++){
>     double C = 3 * Math.pow(t, 2) + 5;
>     System.out.println("C is " + C + " when t is " + t);
> }
> ```

Write a Java program segment that chooses the correct equation to be used when the value of *t* is entered. User has to enter the value of *t* first.

* *C* = -3*t*² + 5 if t >= 0
* *C* = 3*t*² + 5 if t < 0

> ```java
> Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
> double C = 0.0;
> int t = 0;
> 
> System.out.print("Enter the value of t: ");
> t = sc.nextInt();
> 
> if(t >= 0){
>     C = -3 * Math.pow(t, 2) + 5;
> }
> else{
>     C = 3 * Math.pow(t, 2) + 5;
> }

# **Question 04**

Program X is used to summarize students' performance. Table below shows a grading table used by the program. User is expected to key in student marks continuously, ranging from 0 to 100. Any input beyond this range will terminate the program execution.

| Mark | Performance | 
| :---: | :---: |
| 80 - 100 | Excellent |
| 50 - 79 | Average |
| 0 - 49 | Weak |

Write a complete Java program that can calculate:
* The number of students based on performance obtained.
* The highest mark.
* The lowest mark.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

class StudentMarksReport{

    public static void main(String[] args){

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int excellentCount = 0, averageCount = 0, weakCount = 0;
        double marks = 0.0, marksHighest = 0.0, marksLowest = 100.0;
        boolean terminate = false;

        while(!terminate){
            System.out.print("Enter a mark: ");
            marks = sc.nextDouble();

            if(marks > 100 || marks < 0){
                terminate = true;
                break;
            }
            else if(marks >= 80){
                excellentCount++;
            }
            else if(marks >= 50){
                averageCount++;
            }
            else{
                weakCount++;
            }

            if(marks > marksHighest){
                marksHighest = marks;
            }

            if(marks < marksLowest){
                marksLowest = marks;
            }
        }

        System.out.println("Number of Excellent students: " + excellentCount);
        System.out.println("Number of Average students: " + averageCount);
        System.out.println("Number of Weak students: " + weakCount);
        System.out.println("Highest marks: " + marksHighest);
        System.out.println("Lowest marks: " + marksLowest);

        sc.close();
    }
}
```
